**private organization** dedicated to managing configs that
absolutely could have lived in one folder — but didn’t.

## What is this?
A highly structured, mildly regrettable collection of:
- dotfiles
- window manager configs
- scripts I will forget how to use

Because:

- folders are for amateurs
- version control makes bad ideas reproducible

## Who is this for?
Me.  
Possibly future-me.  
Definitely not you.

## Stability
- Works on my machine™
- May break after reboot
